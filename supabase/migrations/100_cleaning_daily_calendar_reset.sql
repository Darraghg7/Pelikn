-- 100: Daily cleaning tasks reset at local midnight, not on a rolling 24h clock
--
-- get_dashboard_snapshot (095) flagged a daily cleaning task overdue only
-- once a full 24 hours had passed since it was last completed. A task
-- finished at 11pm read as "on time" until 11pm the next day, even though a
-- new day's clean was due from midnight. useCleaningTasks.ts (the /cleaning
-- page's source of truth) already resets daily tasks at the venue's local
-- midnight via calendarDaysBetween() — this migration brings the dashboard
-- snapshot's daily case in line with it, using the venue-local day
-- boundaries the client already passes in for every other "today" count in
-- this function.
--
-- Weekly/fortnightly/monthly/quarterly are untouched: those are intentionally
-- a rolling window from the last completion, not a calendar reset — ticking
-- one off pushes the next due date out by its frequency, it doesn't wait for
-- a fixed calendar boundary.
--
-- Full CREATE OR REPLACE — everything but the `cleaning` CTE is copied
-- unchanged from 095_dashboard_snapshot.sql.
